## An overview of the project and its purpose
### In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
### Part 2: Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, with similar exercises on the third day of class, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code.
